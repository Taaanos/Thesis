\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
Foremost, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my thesis advisor Associate Professor Dimitrios Mitrakos. Firstly, for giving me the freedom and guidance to work on a fairly new and unexplored topic, and secondly for his openness and patience. Besides my advisor, I would also like to thank my mentor during my internship at IBM, Luigi Venti, for his support, guidance and ideas. My grateful thanks are also extended to Dr. Gero Dittmann and Dr. Jens Jelitto from IBM Research Zurich for our collaboration on performance analysis on their project. Additionally, I would also like to show my appreciation to Arne Rutjes for his ideas, connections, knowledge and genuine interest on the subject as well as to all my colleagues who contributed with their ideas, open discussions and suggestions. Furthermore, I wish to express my gratitude to the IBM CIC Benelux for giving me the opportunity to do research, collaborate and write this thesis as well as to Ieremias Athanasiadis for introducing me to the group.

Finally, I want to thank my friends and peers for all their crucial support during difficult moments and for inspiring me throughout my studies with their exquisite work and contributions.

Ultimately, I want to express my deepest gratitude to my family, my brother for his crucial help and especially my mother, who unquestionably supported and encouraged me throughout my life.
